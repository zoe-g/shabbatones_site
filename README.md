# Website for Penn Shabbatones

This is the source code for a custom website designed for the Penn Shabbatones, a college a cappella group. It is designed to incorporate text and audio along with social, multimedia and commerce features as relevant for a musical performance group, and provide a way to update all content on a regular basis without requiring coding knowledge from the admin.
