    <p>Every year, the Shabbatones take our show on the road and travel around the world bringing our love of Jewish music to new places including Florida, California, London, Houston and New Orleans. In addition to performing for synagogues and country clubs, we love singing with students and teaching them to sing our favorite tunes during workshop sessions. Singing along with temple choirs, helping lead services and talking to students about Jewish life on campus are all parts of what makes tour our most memorable time of the year. Stay tuned to find out about our upcoming tour locations. We can't wait to share our joy for music with more Jewish communities, yours could be next!</p>
